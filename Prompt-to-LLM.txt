You are a database design expert.
I am giving you an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) of a Tiny College database.
Your task is to generate accurate Mermaid ER diagram code (erDiagram) that represents this database.

Instructions
Use erDiagram syntax in Mermaid.
Clearly define entities, primary keys (PK), and foreign keys (FK).
Correctly represent relationships and cardinalities.
Use meaningful relationship labels where applicable.
Output only the Mermaid code, no explanations.

Database Description
The database models a college with professors, students, departments, courses, classes, rooms, buildings, and enrollments.
Entities and Attributes
PROFESSOR = {PK: PROF_NUM,PROF_CODE,PROF_SPECIALTY,PROF_RANK,PROF_LNAME,PROF_FNAME,PROF_INITIAL,PROF_EMAIL}
SCHOOL = {PK: SCHOOL_CODE,SCHOOL_NAME,FK: PROF_NUM (Dean)}
DEPARTMENT = {PK: DEPT_CODE,DEPT_NAME,FK: SCHOOL_CODE,FK: PROF_NUM (Chair)}
STUDENT = {PK: STU_NUM,STU_LNAME,STU_FNAME,STU_INITIAL,STU_EMAIL,FK: DEPT_CODE,FK: PROF_NUM (Advisor)}
COURSE = {PK: CRS_CODE,CRS_TITLE,CRS_DESCRIPTION,CRS_CREDIT,FK: DEPT_CODE}
CLASS = {PK: CLASS_CODE,CLASS_SECTION,CLASS_TIME,FK: CRS_CODE,FK: PROF_NUM,FK: ROOM_CODE}
ENROLL = {PK, FK: CLASS_CODE, PK, FK: STU_NUM,ENROLL_DATE,ENROLL_GRADE}
ROOM = {PK: ROOM_CODE,ROOM_TYPE,FK: BLDG_CODE}
BUILDING = {PK: BLDG_CODE,BLDG_NAME,BLDG_LOCATION}

Relationships
A school employs professors and operates departments
A professor is dean of a school (optional)
A professor chairs a department
A department offers courses
A professor teaches classes
A course generates classes
A student enrolls in classes (many-to-many via ENROLL)
A student is advised by a professor
A class is held in a room
A room is located in a building
